    <p>Hi Mahal ko,</p>
    <p>I made this little site just for you.  
    Every time I look at your smile, I remember why I hold on because youâ€™re worth every second.  
    Weâ€™ve had our ups and downs, but I never stop choosing you.</p>
    <p>This is a small gift, but I hope it makes you feel how much I care.  
    Thank you for being my person. I love you.</p>

    Mahal youâ€™re my peace, my calm in chaos, and the reason my heart feels full.  
     I may not always find the perfect words, but please knowcIâ€™m so deeply grateful for you.  
     For your presence, your love, your softness for just being you.  
      Youâ€™re the one I want to share every laugh, every quiet moment, every dream with.<br><br>

 Mahal ko,

 Mahal ko Sometimes, we don't always see things the same way, and we both have our flaws â€” but that's okay. What matters to me is that we keep trying, together.  
There are moments I wish I could say everything I'm feeling without making it seem like a complaint, but it's really just me wanting you to understand â€” that I feel too.  

I love you deeply, and I'm not asking for anything grand in return. Just a little reminder every now and then that I matter to you too.  
I know life has been hard lately, and Iâ€™ve seen you face your battles. Through it all, Iâ€™ve stayed by your side, not because I have to, but because I want to â€” because I love you.  

Iâ€™ll keep doing the things that make you smile, because that brings me joy too. But in the middle of all that, I just hope you donâ€™t forget about me.  
I may not be perfect, but I promise to always try â€” to love you in a way that feels right, safe, and true to who we are.  

Mahal ko You know that you are my world, my calm, my home.  
And no matter what we go through, Iâ€™ll always choose you â€” again and again.  
Letâ€™s learn from our mistakes, and more than that, letâ€™s teach each other how we want to be loved, so we can grow stronger without hurting each other anymore.  

Mahal ko, I love every part of you â€” your strength, your softness, your quiet, and your light.  
You are where my heart rests. Always.<br><br>

    Baket ko I love you so much. ðŸ’–
